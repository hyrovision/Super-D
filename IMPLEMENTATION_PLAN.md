## 1. Existing Project Analysis

### Current Codebase State
- **Git Branch:** `frontend-development` (created from `main`).
- **Framework & Build System:** React 18.3.1, Vite 6.0.3, TypeScript 5.6.3.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 3.4.17 with PostCSS and Autoprefixer.
- **Iconography & Visuals:** Lucide React 0.468.0.
- **Charts:** Recharts 2.15.0.
- **Routing:** React Router DOM 6.28.0 (`createBrowserRouter`).
- **Utilities:** `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`.
- **Initial Code Baseline:** The project was initialized with a generic hospital administration template titled "Aarogya Hospital" featuring 9 generic roles (`Hospital Owner`, `Global Admin`, `Branch Manager`, `Doctor`, `HR Manager`, `Finance Manager`, `Marketing Manager`, `Complaints and Query Manager`, `Receptionist`) and routes (`/dashboards/owner`, `/patients`, `/appointments`, etc.).
- **Build Status:** Verified passing `npm run build` after `npm install`.

### Critical Finding
The initial template is misaligned with the Super D product requirements defined in `SDD.md` and the supplied reference screenshots:
1. Branding is currently "Aarogya Hospital" instead of "Super D" ("Care Today, Healthier Tomorrow" and "Compassion / Care / Community").
2. Roles in existing code (9 generic personas) do not match the 7 official Super D roles defined in SDD Section 5 & 19.
3. Routes do not match the SDD Section 18 route architecture (`/dashboard`, `/advertisements`, `/income-reports`, `/revenue-accounts`, `/attendance`, `/grievances`, `/patient-discharge`, `/leave-permission`, `/profile`, `/settings`, `/access-denied`).
4. Visual design (currently dark navy sidebar and generic tables) does not match the crisp, premium healthcare UI shown in the reference screenshots (light sidebar with hospital watermark, bright blue active states, 4-panel filter cards, 2x2 platform/status checkboxes, exact KPI cards, split report tables).

---

## 2. Existing Technology Stack Preservation

We strictly preserve the existing stack without introducing unnecessary frameworks or packages:
- **Core:** HTML5 + TypeScript + React 18
- **Bundler:** Vite 6
- **CSS:** Tailwind CSS 3 (configured with custom tokens matching Super D design)
- **Icons:** Lucide React
- **Charts:** Recharts (AreaChart, BarChart, LineChart, PieChart/Donut)
- **Routing:** React Router DOM v6
- **Data/State:** Typed in-memory state with mockStore pattern, React Context, and localStorage persistence for presentation stability.

No packages will be removed or rewritten unnecessarily.

---

## 3. Existing Architecture

- **`src/App.tsx`:** Root app wrapping providers (`ToastProvider`, `AuthProvider`, `BranchProvider`, `RouterProvider`).
- **`src/app/providers/`:**
  - `AuthProvider.tsx`: Role state, demo role switcher, user profile, permission checks.
  - `BranchProvider.tsx`: Active branch selector (`Trichy`, `Chennai`, `Madurai`, `Pudukottai` + All Branches).
  - `ToastProvider.tsx`: User feedback notifications for CRUD actions.
- **`src/components/layout/`:**
  - `AppShell.tsx`: Application container coordinating Sidebar, TopNav, MobileNav, and content outlet.
  - `DesktopSidebar.tsx`: Persistent desktop navigation.
  - `TopNav.tsx`: Top header with branch selector, notifications menu, and user/role avatar dropdown.
  - `MobileNav.tsx`: Responsive drawer for tablet/mobile.
- **`src/components/ui/`:** Reusable UI primitives (`Button`, `Card`, `Badge`, `Modal`, `KPICard`, `Drawer`, `Tabs`).
- **`src/components/tables/`:** `DataTable` with search, sorting, and pagination.
- **`src/services/`:** `mockStore.ts` managing mock domain entities with subscription and localStorage hydration.

---

## 4. Existing Completed Features

- Functional mockStore infrastructure with persistence and listener subscriptions.
- Working base UI components (`Card`, `Badge`, `Button`, `Modal`, `KPICard`, `Tabs`).
- Working Toast notification context for interactive feedback.
- Vite build and TypeScript compilation passing cleanly.

---

## 5. Existing Incomplete / Misaligned Features

1. **Brand Identity:** Incorrect logo, name, and color theme across login, sidebar, and headers.
2. **Role Model:** Mismatched role definitions and permissions.
3. **Route Architecture:** Old routes (`/dashboards/owner`, `/appointments`, `/complaints`, `/finance`, etc.) need to be replaced/mapped to official SDD routes (`/dashboard`, `/advertisements`, `/income-reports`, `/revenue-accounts`, `/attendance`, `/grievances`, `/patient-discharge`, `/leave-permission`, `/profile`, `/settings`, `/access-denied`).
4. **Screens Missing or Incomplete:**
   - Super Admin: Advertisement Management (exact screenshot layout), Income Reports (exact charts and WhatsApp-sourced tables), Patient Discharge Summary.
   - Admin: Attendance Management (tabs, filters, HR review stage, Approve/Reject), Grievances (4 KPI cards, concern types, view modal).
   - HR: Attendance Management (cross-branch visibility, pending review queue).
   - Branch Doctor: Attendance Management (branch-scoped) & Patient Discharge Summary (3 KPI cards, table with entry/exit dates and age).
   - Branch Manager: Attendance Management (branch approval controls).
   - Staff: Advertisement Management (with Add form), Revenue & Accounts (with Add form and income/expense breakdown), Patient Discharge Management (clean list/placeholder without unconfirmed fields).
   - Employee: Leave & Permission Request (2-day advance notice banner, auto-calculated duration, 0/200 char count, attachment, My Requests table).
   - Login Screen: Super D branded login with quick role switcher for all 7 roles.
   - Role-Specific Dashboards: Distinct executive dashboards for each of the 7 roles matching SDD Section 9 and preview infographics.

---

## 6. SDD Requirements (Functional Source of Truth)

- **Branches (4):** Trichy, Chennai, Madurai, Pudukottai.
- **Roles (7):**
  1. Super Admin: Organization-wide monitoring, ads, income reports, discharge summary.
  2. Admin: Cross-branch administration, attendance management, employee grievances.
  3. HR: Attendance management, cross-branch review workflows.
  4. Branch Doctor: Branch-scoped attendance and patient discharge operations.
  5. Branch Manager: Branch-scoped attendance and approval workflows.
  6. Staff: Branch-scoped ads, revenue & accounts, patient discharge management.
  7. Employee: Own leave and permission requests (self-service).
- **Attendance Workflow:** Submitted → HR Review → Approved / Rejected → Finalized (separate `status` and `reviewStage`).
- **Advance Notice Policy:** 2-day advance submission validation.
- **Strict Prohibition on Invention:**
  - Do NOT invent unconfirmed Staff Patient Discharge fields (keep a clean list/placeholder).
  - Do NOT invent unconfirmed Manager vs HR approval hierarchy (keep flexible/configurable).
  - Keep prototype authorization frontend-simulated while maintaining clean service boundaries.

## 10. Routing & RBAC Plan

### Route Matrix
| Path | Screen Component | Permitted Roles |
|---|---|---|
| `/login` | `LoginView` | Public |
| `/dashboard` | `RoleDashboardView` | All Roles (renders role-specific dashboard) |
| `/advertisements` | `AdvertisementManagementView` | Super Admin, Staff |
| `/income-reports` | `IncomeReportsView` | Super Admin |
| `/revenue-accounts` | `RevenueAccountsView` | Super Admin, Staff |
| `/attendance` | `AttendanceManagementView` | Super Admin, Admin, HR, Branch Doctor, Branch Manager |
| `/grievances` | `GrievancesView` | Admin |
| `/patient-discharge` | `PatientDischargeSummaryView` | Super Admin, Branch Doctor, Staff |
| `/leave-permission` | `EmployeeLeaveRequestView` | Employee, HR, Branch Doctor, Branch Manager |
| `/profile` | `ProfileView` | All Roles |
| `/settings` | `SettingsView` | All Roles |
| `/access-denied` | `AccessDeniedView` | All Roles |
| `*` | Redirect to `/dashboard` | Authenticated |

### Centralized Permission Guard
A single configuration file `src/routes/rolePermissions.ts` defines:
```ts
export const ROLE_ROUTE_ACCESS: Record<RoleType, string[]> = {
  'Super Admin': ['/dashboard', '/advertisements', '/income-reports', '/patient-discharge', '/profile', '/settings'],
  'Admin': ['/dashboard', '/attendance', '/grievances', '/profile', '/settings'],
  'HR': ['/dashboard', '/attendance', '/leave-permission', '/profile', '/settings'],
  'Branch Doctor': ['/dashboard', '/attendance', '/patient-discharge', '/leave-permission', '/profile', '/settings'],
  'Branch Manager': ['/dashboard', '/attendance', '/leave-permission', '/profile', '/settings'],
  'Staff': ['/dashboard', '/advertisements', '/revenue-accounts', '/patient-discharge', '/profile', '/settings'],
  'Employee': ['/dashboard', '/leave-permission', '/profile', '/settings'],
};
```
Guarded by `<ProtectedRoute>` which redirects unauthorized roles to `/access-denied`.

## 13. Responsive Implementation Plan

- **Desktop (>= 1280px):** Full multi-column dashboard layouts, sticky sidebar, side-by-side charts, expanded tables.
- **Laptop (1024px - 1279px):** Balanced grids, 2-column or 3-column KPI card layouts, responsive chart containers.
- **Tablet (768px - 1023px):** Collapsible sidebar toggle via hamburger menu, horizontal table scrolling with fixed headers, stacked filter cards.
- **Mobile (< 768px):** Drawer sidebar, stacked cards, full-width modal forms, touch-friendly controls.

---

## 14. Error Handling & Self-Debugging Strategy

- Run `tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` after every major implementation step.
- Diagnose and fix all type, import, or CSS errors directly using the self-debugging loop.
- Never use `any` shortcuts, suppress errors, or disable TypeScript.

---

## 15. Risk Areas and Mitigations

1. **Risk:** Overwriting existing working code when aligning routes and types.
   - **Mitigation:** Keep existing domain types compatible, extend rather than delete unnecessarily, and update mock seed data cleanly.
2. **Risk:** Inconsistent charts vs tables during demo.
   - **Mitigation:** Compute chart metrics directly from the underlying seeded mock data.
3. **Risk:** Unconfirmed workflow assumptions.
   - **Mitigation:** Adhere strictly to SDD: do not force an unconfirmed approval order or invent unconfirmed Staff discharge fields.

## 1. Executive Summary & Purpose

This repository delivers the **Release D0 Interactive Demonstration** of the **Aarogya Multi-Branch Hospital Management & Administration Platform**, built strictly according to the product specifications in [`spec.md`](./spec.md).

The platform models operational workflows for a 4-branch tertiary care hospital network in Tamil Nadu:
- **Trichy (Main Hub / Flagship)** — Tertiary & Emergency Center (250 beds)
- **Chennai (Speciality)** — Advanced Cardiac & Oncology Center (350 beds)
- **Madurai (Regional)** — Multi-Speciality Care Center (180 beds)
- **Pudukkottai (Outreach)** — Rural & Outpatient Center (75 beds)

Release D0 serves as a high-fidelity client demo for executive stakeholders, hospital directors, department heads, and clinicians to test user flows, role-based security boundaries, clinical workflows, and administrative dashboards before backend and cloud infrastructure are deployed.

## 6. Key Demo Capabilities & Interactions

### A. Dynamic Branch Scoping
- The active branch can be toggled at any time using the header branch selector (`All Branches`, `Trichy`, `Chennai`, `Madurai`, `Pudukkottai`).
- When a specific branch is selected, all KPIs, patient lists, appointment schedules, employee directories, and financial ledgers immediately filter to that branch.

### B. Leave Approval & Mandatory Rejection Reason
- Navigate to `/leave` and locate any pending leave request.
- Clicking **Reject** opens a modal requiring a formal justification reason.
- The confirmation button remains disabled / validates until a meaningful reason (e.g. *"Staffing shortage on duty shift"*) is entered, preventing accidental or unjustified rejections.

### C. Grievance Tracking & SLA Enforcement
- Navigate to `/complaints` to inspect patient and attendant feedback.
- Tickets approaching or exceeding SLA thresholds display red **"Breach"** or amber **"Attention"** indicators.
- Resolving a ticket requires logging the formal corrective action taken.

### D. Hospital Revenue Breakdown (9 Mandatory Categories)
- The Finance module (`/finance`) enforces the complete 9-category hospital income breakdown:
  1. **OPD Consultation**
  2. **IPD Bed Charges**
  3. **Lab / Diagnostics**
  4. **Pharmacy**
  5. **Surgical Procedures**
  6. **Emergency / Casualty**
  7. **Teleconsultation**
  8. **Ambulance Services**
  9. **Miscellaneous**
- Recording a new income transaction instantly updates branch revenue totals, cashless share calculations, and the live transaction ledger.

### E. Mobile-First Responsive Experience
- Test on viewport widths down to **390px** (e.g., iPhone 14/15, Samsung Galaxy).
- Desktop side navigation automatically shifts to an accessible **Mobile Bottom Navigation Bar** with a slide-up drawer for secondary modules.
- Tables gracefully transform into optimized touch-friendly card stacks.

## 7. Data Reset & State Management

All mutations made during demonstration sessions (adding patients, scheduling appointments, approving/rejecting leave, resolving complaints, logging income) are persisted in the browser's `localStorage`.

To restore the environment to baseline seed data at any time:
1. Open the **User Profile Dropdown** in the top right corner of the navigation bar.
2. Click **"Reset Demo Data"**.
3. Confirm the dialog prompt. The application will re-initialize all collections from clean seed fixtures.

Alternatively, execute in the browser console:
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('aarogya_demo_store_v1');
window.location.reload();
```
